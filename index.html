<h1> Hello Everyone!</h1>
<p> Welcome to the first webpage of a student named Christopher Trotter, which is me! Well, it's really not as I created a webpage in
an internet programming course, but let's just say that this is the real first one.</p>
<p> In the coming months, you will see more cool content added on my page. Keep checking for that! </p>
