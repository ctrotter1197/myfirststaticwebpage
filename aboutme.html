<p> Hello, guys! As you can see at the top, my name is Christopher Trotter! I was born and raised in California in 1997.
    When I was 3 years old, I was diagnosed with Autism, which still affects me to this day. In 2005, I attended Village
Glen West, a school in Culver City designed specifically for children with Autism. I was there for 2nd through 8th grade.
In late June of 2012, me and my family moved to the state of Georgia and have resided there ever since. In August of that
year, I attended North Cobb High School and graduated there in 2016. I may add that I ended up graduating with honors.
Later in 2016, I chose to attend Kennesaw State University to major in Computer Science. I am on track to graduate KSU later
this year.</p>
